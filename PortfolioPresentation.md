## Multithreaded Sudoku Solver
Click here to view this project's code repository

This project was made with Java (Libraries: Concurrent, Arraylist).

This software takes a Sudoku board as an input (array of numbers from 1 to 9, with 0's reprensenting empty cells), solves the board through a recursive algorithm and prints the result.

An example of an initial Sudoku board to solve:

![starting board](https://github.com/RealMaximeCaloz/Portfolio/blob/ba2f7d42176e32726565c832dc0f597c661cd021/startingboard.png)

If the board is unsolvable, that information will be printed for the user.

A new ExecutorService job is submitted for each number which would be a valid guess for the Sudoku board's first empty cell, hence harnessing the power of multithreading and parallel processing.

The Sudoku board is solved very quickly, even if it is near-impossible to solve for humans:

## Commercial Bulk Instagram Post Generator
Click here to view this project's code repository

This project was made with Java (Libraries: AWT, I/O, Graphics).

This software takes into input a folder filled with images (backgrounds for posts), and an array of strings with the text to add to each post.

This software will crop all the images in bulk down to square size, dim the images to increase constrast with text, and will add 1 string from the array of strings to each image.

This effectively generates Instagram posts in bulk extremely quickly with little-to-no effort.

You can even brand the posts with your own Instagram handle, to prevent content stealing, and free publicity.

If you want to generate 1000 posts in seconds, so that you do not have to worry about content creation for the next 3 years, you can simply use this software.

Example of a generated Instagram post:
