## Multithreaded Sudoku Solver
Link to this project's code repository
This project was made with Java (Concurrent, Arraylist).

This software takes a Sudoku board as an input (array of numbers from 1 to 9, with 0's reprensenting empty cells), solves the board through a recursive algorithm and prints the result.
If the board is unsolvable, that information will be printed for the user.
A new ExecutorService job is submitted for each number which would be a valid guess for the Sudoku board's first empty cell, hence harnessing the power of multithreading and parallel processing.

An example of an initial Sudoku board to solve:

The Sudoku board is solved very quickly:
